Boulder Angular Meetup : Animation
========================

Howdy folks. This is the code for your experimental enjoyment.

To run the project you will need bower. If you don't already have bower
you can install it like so:

```
  npm install -g bower
```

(npm is a part of node.js, if you don't have node.js please install it
your life in javaScript will improve dramatically)

Otherwise just install the dependencies like so:

```
  bower install
```

Last serve the project somehow. There is no server-side or build step,
just serve the folder with nginx or mamp.
